Current Branch: 
-Work on Alternative Keys Label or something to show what other things the user could maybe go for
//next feature to work on is visualization of the lower end and higher end to see what can be navigated between.
-Look into logic for adding in suggestions for Capos and Transpositions
-Include how much room on each side there is, if we wanted to look at alternative keys. Maybe even have a list of all other possible keys
-Add in support for optimized key
-For now, lets try to use the optimized key and not worry so much about isGuitarFriendly setting
//TODO: handle Advanced Search Settings

-potentially could do an arrow tabbing type of deal, or even a carousel that the user can swipe through



//TODO: handle custom vocalists
//put the api call for the songs and singers inside of the keyfinderform component
//TODO:Change the Tab Icon, and also the tab Label
